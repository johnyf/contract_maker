Construction of temporal logic contracts for distributed systems,
starting from GR(1) specifications.
This implementation is experimental, so expect changes.

The theory is described in the paper:

  [Symbolic construction of GR(1) contracts for systems with full information][1]<br>
  The 2016 American Control Conference (ACC)<br>
  Boston, MA, July 6--8, 2016

with proofs and more details in the technical report:
